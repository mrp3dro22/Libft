# Libft

Hey there! 

My name is Pedro Almeida and I'm currently a student at 42 Lisbon. 

This is my first ever project in the 42's course named CommonCore, and as you might have already seen, it's called Libft!

This project is named after the C Standard Library, LibC, and it not only recreates some of the most used functions of the standard library, but it also makes you create some modified versions of many others as well! It's a great way to learn how to code, as well as a great way to be able to modify everyday functions as you wish, in a way that is most useful for you throughout not only 42's project, but as well as your personal ones!
